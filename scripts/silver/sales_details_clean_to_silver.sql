  SCRIPT NAME: Clean & Prepare CRM Sales Data
  PURPOSE: Identify and fix invalid values in bronze.crm_sales_details table 
           before inserting into Silver Layer
  DATA SOURCE: bronze.crm_sales_details
  TARGET LAYER: Silver Layer
===========================================

üîç OVERVIEW:
- This script identifies bad records in the CRM sales data.
- The cleaned and corrected records are prepared for insertion into the Silver Layer.
*/-- Data Cleaning & Transformation from BRONZE Layer: crm_sales_details to silver.crm_sales_details

-- Goal: Clean incorrect or inconsistent data before loading into the Silver Layer.

-- 1.Clean and Format Date Columns (Order Date, Ship Date, Due Date):
--     ‚Ä¢ If the date is '0' or not exactly 8 digits (i.e., not in 'YYYYMMDD' format), set it to NULL.
--     ‚Ä¢ Otherwise, cast the 8-digit integer to VARCHAR, then to DATE.

-- 2. Handle Sales Values (sls_sales):
--     ‚Ä¢ If sls_sales is NULL, zero, or not equal to Quantity √ó Price,
--         ‚Üí Derive it as: sls_sales = sls_quantity √ó ABS(sls_price)
--     ‚Ä¢ Otherwise, keep the original value.

-- 3. Retain sls_quantity as-is:
--     ‚Ä¢ Quantity is assumed to be clean based on earlier observation.

-- 4. Handle Price Values (sls_price):
--    If sls_price is NULL, zero, or negative,
--    Calculate it as: sls_price = sls_sales √∑ sls_quantity
--    (uses NULLIF to avoid division by zero).
--    Otherwise, retain the original sls_price value.
