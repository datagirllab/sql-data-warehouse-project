   VIEW NAME     : gold.dim_customers
   LAYER         : Gold Layer
   TYPE          : Dimension View (Customer Dimension)

   PURPOSE:
   - Build a cleaned and integrated customer dimension view for reporting.
   - Make business field names easy to understand for stakeholders.
   - Ensure consistent and reliable customer data across systems.

   KEY STEPS:
   1. Created a view (not a physical table) for flexibility and reusability.
   2. Joined CRM and ERP customer-related tables:
      - CRM is treated as the master source (LEFT JOIN).
   3. Performed data integration:
      - Used CRM gender where available, else fallback to ERP.     
   4. Applied business-friendly naming conventions:
      - E.g., 'cust_firstname' → 'first_name', 'cst_key' → 'customer_number'.
   5. Generated a surrogate key using ROW_NUMBER():
      - Since no natural primary key exists in the source data.


   NOTE:
   This view is part of the dimensional modeling in the Gold Layer,
   specifically representing the **Customer Dimension**.

   USAGE EXAMPLE:
   SELECT * FROM gold.dim_customers WHERE country = 'Germany';
