   VIEW NAME     : gold.dim_products
   LAYER         : Gold Layer
   TYPE          : Dimension View (Product Dimension)

   PURPOSE:
   - Build a cleaned and enriched product dimension view for reporting.
   - Integrate product data from CRM with category details from ERP.
   - Simplify field names for better business understanding.

   KEY STEPS:
   1. Created a view (not a physical table) for flexibility and reuse.
   2. Used CRM product data as the master source.
   3. Joined ERP product category table for enrichment:
      - Added category, subcategory, and maintenance info.
   4. Filtered for current products only:
      - Excluded historical records by selecting only those where prd_end_dt IS NULL.
   5. Applied business-friendly naming:
      - E.g., 'prd_key' → 'product_number', 'prd_nm' → 'product_name'.
   6. Generated a surrogate key using ROW_NUMBER():
      - Ensures each product has a unique identifier.

   NOTE:
   This view is part of the dimensional model in the Gold Layer,
   specifically representing the **Product Dimension**.

   USAGE EXAMPLE:
   SELECT * FROM gold.dim_products WHERE category = 'Accessories';
