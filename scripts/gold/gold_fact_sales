   VIEW NAME     : gold.fact_sales
   LAYER         : Gold Layer
  
   PURPOSE:
   - Build a centralized fact table capturing transactional sales data.
   - Enable analytical teams to perform revenue, quantity, and performance analysis.
   - Link key business measures to dimension tables for rich, contextual reporting.

    STEPS:
   1. Pulled transactional sales records from the Silver Layer.
   2. Linked sales data to dimension tables:
      - Joined to gold.dim_products on product key.
      - Joined to gold.dim_customers on customer key.
   3. Mapped raw sales fields to clear business-friendly names:
      - E.g., sls_sales → sales_amount, sls_order_dt → order_date.
   4. Used LEFT JOINs to retain all sales records, even if dimension data is incomplete.

   NOTE:
   This view is part of the dimensional modeling in the Gold Layer,
   specifically representing the **Sales Fact Table** in a Star Schema.

   USAGE EXAMPLE:
   SELECT * FROM gold.fact_sales;
